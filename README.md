# Marketing

The [GraphQL Foundation](https://graphq.org/foundation) Marketing Subcommittee, reconstituted in January 2023, plays a crucial role in orchestrating and executing marketing initiatives in support of the Foundation and its various projects. As part of the GraphQL Foundation Board's efforts, the Marketing Subcommittee collaborates with several other subcommittees, all dedicated to working on new and exciting projects planned for this year. Announcements about these programs and projects will be released throughout 2023.

More details on new projects and programs for 2023 will be released soon. Watch this README for updates.

The Marketing Subcommittee maintains transparency in its operations, making meeting agendas and minutes openly accessible in the meetings/ directory. Once our regular meetings are scheduled, this README will be updated with the dates and times along with adding them to the [Foundation's public calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0/embed?src=linuxfoundation.org_ik79t9uuj2p32i3r203dgv5mo8@group.calendar.google.com).
