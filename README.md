# Marketing

The GraphQL Foundation marketing committee is responsible for coordinating marketing activities in support of the [Foundation](https://foundation.graphql.org) and the [projects](https://github.com/graphql). We meet regularly, and welcome participation from Foundation and community members.

Our meeting agendas and minutes are open and available in [meetings/](./meetings/). We generally meet on the fourth Thursday of the month at 9a PT.
